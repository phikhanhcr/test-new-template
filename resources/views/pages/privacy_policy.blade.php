                                    Cookie data are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers. Cookies
                                    are used to store and receive identifiers and other information on computers, phones and
                                    other devices. Other technologies, including data stored on your web browser or device,
                                    identifiers associated with your device and other software, are used for similar
                                    purposes. In this Policy, Planbig refers to all of these technologies as “cookies”. We
                                    use cookies if you have an account (team space) on Planbig. This Policy explains why we
                                    use cookies and the choices you have.

                                    We use cookies to help us provide, protect and improve the Services (which includes the
                                    Planbig websites and apps), by personalizing content and providing a safer experience.
                                    We may set or log data stored in cookies or local storage objects to automatically
                                    collect this information. Your web browser or device offer settings to manage cookie

                                    Access to some features or Services will be disabled or may function improperly.

                                    Do we intentionally collect data from children under the age of 16?
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Planbig Services are not intended for children under 16 years of age, and we do not
                                    knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we learn we have
                                    collected or received personal information from a child under 16 without verification of
                                    parental consent, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe we might
                                    have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at:
                                    info@planbig.net.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    When do we collect personal information?
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Browsing Planbig web pages is possible without indication of personal data. However, if
                                    a person wants to use Planbig Services via our website or apps, processing of personal
                                    data is necessary for the proper delivery of the Services. The user signs up for a team
                                    space account on the Planbig website with the indication of personal data. The personal
                                    data we receive is determined by the form used during the signup process. By signing up
                                    on the Planbig website, the IP address, date and time (timestamp) of the registration
                                    are also stored.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    The storage of this data is the only way to prevent the misuse of our Services, and, if
                                    necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses. Moreover, the storage
                                    of this data is necessary to secure Planbig as a data controller. This data is not
                                    passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data,
                                    or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    How do we use the information we collect?

                                    We use the collected information to provide and improve the Services delivered by

                                    In addition to the uses identified in this Privacy Policy, we may use your Personal
                                    Information to:

                                    <br /><br />
                                    If you give us credit card information, we use it solely to check your financial
                                    qualifications and collect payment from you. We use a third-party service provider to
                                    manage credit card processing. This service provider is not permitted to store, retain,
                                    or use information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on

                                    What information do we collect and use from our newsletter subscribers?
                                    <br /><br />
                                    On the Planbig websites, users have an opportunity to subscribe to our newsletter.
                                    Planbig informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter
                                    about product updates and marketing insights. Planbig newsletter is sent to users if:
                                    the user has an existing email address and gives consent to subscribe to the newsletter.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    During the subscription to the newsletter, we also store the IP address, date and time
                                    of the subscription. The collection of this data is necessary to understand the possible
                                    misuse of the email address of the user at a later date, and it serves as the legal
                                    protection of the Planbig, Inc. company.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    The personal data collected as part of a subscription for the newsletter will only be
                                    used to send our newsletter. In addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed
                                    by email in case of modifications to the newsletter delivery, or during the change in
                                    technical circumstances. We do not transfer any personal data collected by the
                                    newsletter service to third parties.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    The subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time.
                                    The consent to the storage of personal data, the data subject has given, may be
                                    withdrawn at any time. To withdraw the consent, simply follow the "Unsubscribe" link in
                                    the footer of any newsletter email. It is also possible to unsubscribe from the
                                    newsletter at any time by getting in touch with our team at Planbig using the ‘Contact
                                    information’ section of this Privacy Policy.

                                    Data retention, account deactivation and deletion
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our Services or until your
                                    account is deleted – whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that
                                    depends on the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal
                                    or operational retention needs.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    It is your right to request deleting a team space, and we reserve the right to process
                                    your request up to 30 business days.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Once the team space is deleted, the team space URL of a deleted team cannot be reused.
                                    You can create a new team space any time choosing any team space URL available.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We do not interfere with the flow of your team space and do not process deleting team
                                    space members that can be done by team space owner or admins.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Team space owner can only be suspended or deleted by team space admins.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We can transfer the team space role to any active team space member, upon request from
                                    the team space owner themself.
                                    <br /><br />

                                    The information that we have is used to help us verify accounts and to promote safety
                                    and security on and off our Services: investigating suspicious activity or violations of
                                    our terms or policies. Protection of your team space data is a top priority for our
                                    teams of engineers, using automated systems and advanced technology such as encryption
                                    and machine learning. For example, we use automated technologies to detect suspicious
                                    activity, that may harm you, other users or our Services.

                                    in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or
                                    other sale or transfer of some or all of Planbig, Inc’s assets, whether as a going

                                    third-party provider AWS in a controlled environment with limited access.

                                    High level of privacy is maintained by the access to your team space data by invitation
                                    only. While signing in to Planbig you can't guess that the team space exists or find out
                                    the team space creator. Sign in to Planbig is implemented with one-time codes, which are
                                    more secure and harder to exploit (unlike using a password for a sign in).
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Our company also got extensive internal policies and perform regular data protection
                                    trainings for our team members. Moreover, our facilities are protected with alarm
                                    systems and all confidential documents are locked and appropriately destroyed if no
                                    longer needed.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    However, safety and security of your information also depend on you. Where we have given
                                    you (or where you have chosen) one-time code or password for access to Planbig Services,
                                    you are responsible for keeping the code or password confidential. We ask you not to
                                    share your code or password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out
                                    information in public areas of the Planbig apps. The information you share in public
                                    areas may be viewed by any user of the Planbig app.

                                    Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is
                                    not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we
                                    cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information transmitted through
                                    our Planbig apps. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are
                                    not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures we
                                    provide.

                                    Do we transfer data internationally?
                                    <br /><br />
                                    The Services we provide to you together with using the service providers, you understand
                                    and agree that information may be stored or processed by us in different locations
                                    worldwide. For example, information collected from the European Economic Area (EEA) may
                                    be transferred to countries outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this
                                    Policy. We maintain standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission, and
                                    rely on the Commission decisions on certain countries, dealing with data transfer from
                                    the EEA to the United States and other countries. For most recipients of your personal
                                    data, this involves only your email address and profile details you provide. This
                                    information is vital for us to deliver the Services to you. We have audited our service
                                    providers and they have all publicly expressed that they are GDPR compliant.

                                    California Online Privacy Protection Act
                                    <br /><br />
                                    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online
                                    services to post a Privacy Policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to
                                    require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
                                    operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
                                    consumers to post a conspicuous Privacy Policy on its website stating exactly the
                                    information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being
                                    shared.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
                                    <br /><br />
                                    users can visit our site anonymously;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    once this Privacy Policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a
                                    minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page
                                    specified above;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    you will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes via email, and you can change your
                                    personal information by logging in to your account.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We don't honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising
                                    when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. We don't honor them because:
                                    DNT is active for guest users.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?
                                    <br /><br />
                                    It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Fair Information Practices
                                    <br /><br />
                                    The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United
                                    States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development
                                    of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
                                    Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
                                    privacy laws that protect personal information.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following
                                    responsive action, should a data breach occur:
                                    <br /><br />
                                    we will notify you via email within 7 business days;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    we also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have
                                    the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors
                                    who fail to adhere to the law.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    CAN SPAM Act
                                    <br /><br />
                                    The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes
                                    requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped
                                    from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We collect your email address in order to:
                                    <br /><br />
                                    send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:
                                    <br /><br />
                                    not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    include the physical address of our business or site headquarters;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly;
                                    <br /><br />
                                    allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.
                                    <br /><br />
