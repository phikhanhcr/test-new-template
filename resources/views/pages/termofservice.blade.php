                                <p>Planbig (“Planbig,” “we,” “our”) offers a variety of team productivity, collaboration,
                                    and organizational tools available online, including via a mobile application
                                    (collectively, the “Service”), and websites. Planbig, Inc. is located at Aschauer
                                    Strasse 32a, 81549 Munich, Germany. If you have any questions about these User Terms of
                                    Service (the “Terms”), please email us at info@planbig.net. Planbig has three different
                                    types of users depending on the Planbig products used:
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We call users of the Websites “Site Visitors.”
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We call users who use the free version of the Planbig Service “Free Users.” While Free
                                    Users can access and use the Service, they have access to a more limited set of Service
                                    features and functionality than Subscribers.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We call users who use the Service as part of a paid Planbig subscription plan
                                    (regardless of the subscription tier) “Subscribers.” The Service features and
                                    functionalities available to Subscribers are determined by the subscription tier and the
                                    specific terms agreed to between Planbig and the organization (e.g., your employer or
                                    another entity or person, called the “Customer”) that entered into a separate agreement
                                    that governs delivery, access, and use of the Service (the “Customer Agreement”).
                                    <br /><br />
                                    We refer to these three types of users collectively as “Users” or “you” for purposes of
                                    these Terms. Regardless of what type of User you are, these Terms create a legal
                                    agreement directly between you and Planbig and explain the rules governing use of the
                                    Service and Websites. By accessing or using the Service and Websites, you acknowledge
                                    and agree that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our
                                    Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the
                                    Service and Websites. We may, from time to time, modify these Terms. Please check this
                                    page periodically for updates. We will comply with applicable local legal obligations to
                                    provide you with notice of changes to these Terms. Your continued use of the Service and
                                    Websites after any such update constitutes your acceptance of such changes.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    1. ELIGIBILITY AND SCOPE
                                    <br /><br />
                                    1.1 General. To use the Service and Websites you must be, and represent and warrant that
                                    you are, at least 13 years of age and competent to agree to these Terms. If Planbig has
                                    previously prohibited you from accessing or using the Service and Websites, you are not
                                    permitted to access or use the Service and Websites.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    1.2 Location. These Terms are applicable to Users outside of the United States. If you
                                    are located in the United States, the terms available at info@planbig.net apply to you.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    2. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND USE
                                    <br /><br />
                                    2.1 Account Registration and Confidentiality. To access the Service and Websites, you
                                    must register for an Planbig account by creating a user name and password. You agree to
                                    provide us with accurate, complete, and current registration information about yourself.
                                    It is your responsibility to ensure that your password remains confidential and secure.
                                    By registering, you agree that you are fully responsible for all activities that occur
                                    under your user name and password. We may assume that any communications we receive
                                    under your account have been made by you. If you are a billing owner, an administrator,
                                    or if you have confirmed in writing that you have the authority to make decisions on
                                    behalf of a Customer (“Account Administrator”), you represent and warrant that you are
                                    authorized to make decisions on behalf of the Customer and agree that Planbig is
                                    entitled to rely on your instructions.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    2.2 Unauthorized Account Use. You are responsible for notifying us at info@planbig.net
                                    if you become aware of any unauthorized use of or access to your account. You understand
                                    and agree that we may require you to provide information that may be used to confirm
                                    your identity and help ensure the security of your account. Planbig will not be liable
                                    for any loss, damages, liability, expenses or attorneys’ fees that you may incur as a
                                    result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your
                                    knowledge and/or authorization, and regardless of whether you have or have not advised
                                    us of such unauthorized use. You will be liable for losses, damages, liability, expenses
                                    and attorneys’ fees incurred by Planbig or a third party due to someone else using your
                                    account. In the event that the Account Administrator or Customer loses access to an
                                    account or otherwise requests information about an account, Planbig reserves the right
                                    to request from the Account Administrator or Customer any verification it deems
                                    necessary before restoring access to or providing information about such account in its
                                    sole discretion.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    3. OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
                                    <br /><br />
                                    The Service and Websites are owned and operated by Planbig and contain materials
                                    (including all software, design, text, editorial materials, informational text,

                                    materials, and names, logos, trademarks and services marks) which are derived in whole
                                    or in part from materials supplied by Planbig and its partners, as well as other
                                    sources, and are protected by United States copyright laws, international treaty
                                    provisions, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property laws. The Service
                                    and Websites are also protected as a collective work or compilation under U.S. and
                                    global copyright and other law and treaties. You agree to abide by all applicable
                                    copyright and other laws, as well as any additional copyright notices or restrictions
                                    contained in the Service and Websites. You acknowledge that the Service and Websites
                                    have been developed, compiled, prepared, revised, selected, and arranged by Planbig and
                                    others through the application of methods and standards of judgment developed and
                                    applied through the expenditure of substantial time, effort, and money and constitute
                                    valuable intellectual property of Planbig and such others. You agree to notify Planbig
                                    immediately upon becoming aware of any claim that the Service and Websites infringe upon
                                    any copyright, trademark, or other contractual, statutory, or common law rights. Any
                                    unauthorized use of any material contained on or through the Service and Websites may
                                    violate copyright laws, trademark laws, the laws of privacy and publicity and
                                    communications regulations and statutes.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    4. USER CONTENT AND FEEDBACK
                                    <br /><br />
                                    4.1 User Content and Submissions on the Service. The Service allows you to create tasks
                                    and submit associated information, text, files, and other materials (collectively, “User
                                    Content”) and to share that User Content with others. User Content submitted or
                                    otherwise made available to the Service is subject to the following terms:
                                    <br /><br />
                                    4.1.1 Free User Content. Free Users maintain ownership of the User Content that they
                                    submit to the Service (“Free User Content”). By submitting Free User Content, Free Users
                                    grant Planbig a license to access, use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, publish,
                                    transmit, and display that Free User Content, as permitted by Planbig’s Privacy Policy,
                                    including if required to do so by law or in good faith to comply with legal process. We
                                    reserve the right to remove any User Content on the Service that violates these Terms or
                                    that is otherwise objectionable in Planbig’s sole discretion.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    4.1.2 Subscriber User Content on the Service. Content submitted to the Service by
                                    Subscribers (“Subscriber User Content”) is owned and controlled by the Customer as set
                                    forth in the introduction to these Terms and the Customer Agreement, except with respect
                                    to Subscriber User Content submitted by students pursuant to a Customer Agreement with
                                    an educational institution (“Student Content”). Such Student Content is owned by the
                                    student and not the educational institution. Planbig maintains a limited, non-exclusive
                                    and non-transferrable (except in connection with the sale or transfer of its business)
                                    license to access, use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, publish, transmit, host, and
                                    display Subscriber User Content for the following limited purposes: (i) to maintain,
                                    provide and improve the Service; (ii) to prevent or address technical or security issues
                                    and resolve support requests; (iii) to investigate when we have a good faith belief, or
                                    have received a complaint alleging, that such Subscriber User Content is in violation of
                                    the Customer Agreement or these Terms; (iv) to comply with a valid legal subpoena,
                                    request, or other lawful process that meets the requirements of the Customer Agreement
                                    and our Law Enforcement Guidelines; and (v) as otherwise set forth in our Customer
                                    Agreement or as expressly permitted in writing by the Customer.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    4.2 Feedback on the Websites. The Websites may have certain features that allow you to
                                    submit comments, information, and other materials (collectively, “Feedback”) to Planbig
                                    and share such Feedback with other users, or the public. By submitting Feedback through
                                    the Websites, you grant Planbig a license to access, use, copy, reproduce, process,
                                    adapt, publish, transmit, host, and display that Feedback for any purpose (including in

                                    If we fail to comply with these Terms, we are responsible for loss or damage that you
                                    suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms or our negligence, but
                                    we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is
                                    foreseeable if it is an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was an order that was
                                    accepted. We also only provide the Service and Websites for your internal use. We have
                                    no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption or

                                    unlawful for us to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by
                                    our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors, for fraud
                                    or fraudulent misrepresentation and for breach of your legal rights in relation to the
                                    Service and Websites.

                                    APAC or the UAE you may benefit from any mandatory provisions of, and legal rights
                                    available to you under, the laws of that country. Nothing in these Terms affects your
                                    rights as a consumer to rely on any such local law mandatory provisions and legal
                                    rights.

                                    You can contact Planbig at info@planbig.net if you have any complaints or disputes about
                                    the Services. You and Planbig shall use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim,
                                    question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations,
                                    which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or other form of
                                    complaint. If we do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of 30 days from
                                    the time informal dispute resolution is pursued, to the extent permitted by applicable
                                    law, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims or causes of action between
                                    you and Planbig arising out of, under, or related to the Services shall be submitted to
                                    the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland. However, if you are a resident of
                                    any other European country, APAC country or the UAE, you may also bring proceedings in
                                    that country.

                                    12. GENERAL TERMS
                                    <br /><br />
                                    12.1. No waiver. If we fail to insist that you perform any obligations under these
                                    Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that
                                    will not mean that we have waived such rights and will not mean that you do not have to
                                    comply with your obligations. If we do waive a failure or breach by you, we will only do
                                    so in writing and that will not mean that we automatically waive any future failure of
                                    breach by you.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    12.2. Severability. Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any
                                    court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the
                                    remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    12.3. Miscellaneous. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have
                                    no legal or contractual effect.
                                    <br /><br />
